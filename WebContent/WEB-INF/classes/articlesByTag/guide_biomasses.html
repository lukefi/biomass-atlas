		Biomasses have been grouped in the "Biomasses" menu according to "Potential" and "Origin".
	</p>
	<p>
		"Potential" refers here to different stages of biomass production and usage. 
		Land use forms the basis for the biomass production. Total production-interleaf 
		gives the total biomass production on a certain land area. Side stream is 
		the share of the biomass, which is left over after the primary usage of the biomass.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Origin" describes, where the biomass originates from: forest, agriculture, communities or companies.
	</p>
	<p>
		More detailed descriptions of the fractions (metadata) are found 
		in the menu "Selected layers", under the info icon of each fraction.

	</p>
	<p>
		Every biomass map layer forms its own dataset. User selections, whether they are selections 
		of other biomasses or background maps, don't affect the pre-calculated biomass potentials. 
		Only the area definition tools affect the amount of biomasses.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can delete all selections using the button at the top right hand corner of the "Biomasses" menu.
